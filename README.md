# Acknowledgement Force

A daily contract for your Mac. Acknowledgement Force gates your screen behind
your own words: the window won't close until you've read today's contract,
ticked the box, and named the one thing that matters most. Free, open source,
and native to macOS.

Optionally, sign in to **sync your contract, quotes, goals, and reflection**
from a web editor — edit from anywhere and it lands on your Mac on launch.

## Two ways to run it

**Hosted (no setup).** Download the prebuilt app (see Releases), create an
account at [force.clupai.com](https://force.clupai.com), and log in. It comes
pre-connected to the hosted backend — edit your contract on the web and it syncs
to your Mac. Best for non-technical users.

**Open source (your backend, or none).** Build from source below. Run it fully
local with no account, or point it at **your own Supabase project** so you own
all your data. Same app, your infrastructure. See
[Sync — edit from anywhere](#sync--edit-from-anywhere).

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer, Apple Silicon or Intel
- Xcode or the Command Line Tools (provides the `swift` compiler):

  ```sh
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Install

Clone the repo and run the installer. It builds a release binary, packages it
into a native `Acknowledgement Force.app`, and installs it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Clupai8o0/force.git
cd force
./install.sh
```

By default the app is installed to `~/Applications` (no `sudo` needed) and
launches when the build finishes.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `./install.sh` | Install to `~/Applications` |
| `./install.sh --system` | Install to `/Applications` (prompts for `sudo`) |
| `./install.sh --prefix DIR` | Install into a custom directory |
| `./install.sh --no-open` | Don't launch the app after installing |
| `./install.sh --replace-others` | Remove copies in other locations without asking |
| `./install.sh --keep-others` | Leave copies in other locations in place |
| `./install.sh --package` | Build a shareable `.zip` in `./dist` instead of installing |

`install.sh` is safe to re-run — it cleanly replaces any previous copy, so it
doubles as the upgrade path.

### No accidental duplicates

Before installing, the script checks the common locations (`~/Applications`,
`/Applications`) and anywhere it has installed before for an existing
`Acknowledgement Force.app` outside the current target. If it finds one — e.g.
you ran the default once and `--system` later — it offers to remove the stray
copy so you don't accumulate duplicates. In an interactive shell it asks;
otherwise pass `--replace-others` or `--keep-others` to decide up front.

Note that even if duplicate bundles exist on disk, the app enforces a
single-instance lock at runtime, so only one copy can ever actually run.

> The app is **ad-hoc signed** for local use. It is not notarized, so if you
> move the `.app` to another Mac, Gatekeeper may warn you. Building from source
> on the target machine (the steps above) avoids that.

## Usage

1. Launch **Acknowledgement Force** from Spotlight or Launchpad.
2. Read the day's contract, tick the acknowledgement box, and write your single
   highest-leverage action. The window stays locked until you do.
3. Once acknowledged, the gate opens and you can close the window.

### Auto-launch

Enable auto-launch from the app's onboarding screen or **Settings**. This
installs a user LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.acknowledgementforce.agent.plist`)
so Force resurfaces on your chosen cadence:

| Frequency | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Every launch | Re-acknowledge each time Force opens |
| Every hour | Re-locks one hour after each acknowledgement |
| Every 12 hours | Re-locks twelve hours after each acknowledgement |
| Once a day | One acknowledgement carries the whole day |
| Once a week | One acknowledgement carries the whole week |
| On login / restart | Re-acknowledge on every login and restart |

Your acknowledgement history is stored locally at
`~/Library/Application Support/Force/acknowledgements.log`.

## Sync — edit from anywhere

Force can pull your **contract, quotes, daily goals, and reflection** from a
Supabase project and push contract/goal edits back — so you can edit on the web
and have it land on your Mac, and vice versa (last edit wins). Acknowledgements,
checklist ticks, and history always stay local to each device.

There's no separate config to maintain: **Settings → 03 — SYNC**. If the build
was pre-connected, you'll just see a login form; otherwise you enter a Supabase
URL + key first.

### Option A — use the hosted backend

Sign up at [force.clupai.com](https://force.clupai.com), then in the app:
**Settings → Sync → log in**. Prebuilt distributable builds are already wired to
the hosted backend, so there are no keys to enter — just log in.

### Option B — bring your own Supabase (open source)

Own all your data by pointing the app at your own project:

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL editor, run `web/supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` (creates the
   `contents` table, row-level security, and a signup trigger). Safe to re-run.
3. *(Optional)* Deploy the web editor in `web/` to Vercel — set **Root
   Directory = `web`** and the env vars `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` +
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Or run it locally with `cd web && pnpm dev`.
4. In the app: **Settings → Sync** → paste your **Project URL** + **anon /
   publishable** key → log in.

The key you enter is the **public** key (anon / publishable), protected by
row-level security — never the `service_role` secret.

### Building a pre-connected distributable

To hand someone a build that's already wired to *your* Supabase (they only log
in or sign up — no keys), bake the credentials at build time:

```sh
FORCE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-REF.supabase.co \
FORCE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_... \
./install.sh --package
```

This embeds the keys, restores the placeholder afterward (**keys never touch
git**), and writes `dist/Acknowledgement-Force-<version>.zip`. The recipient
unzips and drags the app to `Applications`. Because the build is ad-hoc signed
(not notarized), on first open they right-click the app and choose **Open** (or
run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "<app>"`). Running `./install.sh` with no
`FORCE_SUPABASE_*` vars produces the plain open-source build (no baked keys).

### Make it stop

If you need to immediately quit the app and stop it from relaunching without a
full uninstall, run:

```sh
./stop.sh
```

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh            # remove the app + auto-launch agent (keeps your data)
./uninstall.sh --purge    # also delete saved history and preferences
./uninstall.sh --system   # also look in /Applications
```

## Build from source (development)

```sh
swift build                 # debug build
swift run Force             # build & run
swift build -c release      # optimized release binary
```

The release binary and its resource bundle (`Force_Force.bundle`) land in the
directory printed by `swift build -c release --show-bin-path`.

## Project layout

```
Sources/Force/      SwiftUI app source + bundled fonts
web/                Next.js web editor + Supabase migration (optional cloud sync)
landing/            Legacy static marketing site (superseded by web/)
install.sh          Build + package + install the .app
uninstall.sh        Remove the app, agent, and (optionally) data
stop.sh             Quit now + disable auto-launch (no uninstall)
VERSION             Release version (drives the bundle version)
```

## Releasing

1. Bump `VERSION` (e.g. `0.2.0`).
2. Commit the change.
3. Tag and push:

   ```sh
   git tag -a "v$(cat VERSION)" -m "Release v$(cat VERSION)"
   git push origin "v$(cat VERSION)"
   ```

The version in `VERSION` is baked into the `.app` bundle's
`CFBundleShortVersionString` at install time.
