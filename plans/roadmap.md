# Force — Roadmap

Two parallel tracks: a public API + MCP server, and a native Android client with system-wide app blocking. Both build on the existing Next.js + Supabase web app (single `contents` row per user containing `contract_md`, `quotes[]`, `goals[]`, `reflection`).

Product framing: Force is a personal accountability app. Users write a contract with themselves, collect motivational quotes, set goals, and reflect daily. The Android app additionally blocks distracting apps until the user re-acknowledges their contract.

---

## Track 1 — MCP server + API keys

**Goal:** generate an API key in the web app, paste it into Claude (or any MCP client), read/update contract, quotes, goals, reflection.

### A. Database — new migration `web/supabase/migrations/0002_api_keys.sql`

```
api_keys
  id            uuid pk
  user_id       uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade
  name          text                       -- "Claude Desktop", "Personal laptop"
  prefix        text  not null             -- "fc_live_a1b2"  (shown in UI)
  key_hash      text  not null unique      -- sha256(raw_key)
  scopes        text[] not null default '{contract:read,contract:write,quotes:read,quotes:write,goals:read,goals:write,reflection:read,reflection:write}'
  last_used_at  timestamptz
  expires_at    timestamptz                -- nullable
  revoked_at    timestamptz                -- nullable
  created_at    timestamptz default now()
```

RLS: users can only see their own rows (`auth.uid() = user_id`). Inserts/revokes happen via the web app under a normal session — no service role from the browser.

### B. Web — settings UI

New routes under `web/app/settings/`:

- `settings/layout.tsx` — sidebar shell (room for account/billing later)
- `settings/api-keys/page.tsx` — list + create + revoke
  - **Create form:** name (required), scope checkboxes (default all on), optional expiry
  - **On create:** generate `fc_live_<24-byte-base62>`, hash with sha256, insert row, return raw key once — display in a modal with copy button and "you won't see this again" warning. Never store raw.
  - **List:** name, prefix + `••••last4`, scopes, last used, created, revoke button
- Add an "API keys" entry to the nav (the editor currently has only a logout button — settle on a single nav source)

### C. Web — public HTTP API (`web/app/api/v1/`)

All routes guarded by the same middleware.

```
GET    /api/v1/me                       → { user_id, email }
GET    /api/v1/contract                 → { contract_md, updated_at }
PUT    /api/v1/contract                 → body: { contract_md }
GET    /api/v1/quotes                   → { quotes: Quote[] }
POST   /api/v1/quotes                   → body: { text, author? }
DELETE /api/v1/quotes/:id
GET    /api/v1/goals                    → { goals: Goal[] }
PUT    /api/v1/goals                    → body: { goals: Goal[] }     (replace-all; simpler than diff)
GET    /api/v1/reflection               → { reflection, updated_at }
PUT    /api/v1/reflection               → body: { reflection }
```

**Middleware** (`web/lib/auth/apiKey.ts`):

1. Pull `Authorization: Bearer fc_...` header
2. sha256 the raw key, look up in `api_keys` where `revoked_at is null and (expires_at is null or expires_at > now())`
3. Check scope matches the route; return 401/403 otherwise
4. Update `last_used_at` (debounced — at most every 60s per key)
5. Return `{ userId, scopes }` for the route to use

**Supabase client inside route handlers:** use the service role key from server env, scope every query with `.eq("user_id", userId)`. RLS isn't doing the work here — we resolved the user ourselves.

### D. MCP server — new top-level `mcp/` directory (separate package)

- Node + TypeScript, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- Thin client wrapping `/api/v1/*`, used by all tools
- **Tools** (1:1 with API methods, plus a couple of conveniences):
  - `get_contract`, `update_contract`
  - `list_quotes`, `add_quote`, `delete_quote`
  - `list_goals`, `set_goals`
  - `get_reflection`, `set_reflection`
  - `append_to_contract` (convenience — read, append, write) so the model doesn't have to round-trip
- **Config:** reads `FORCE_API_KEY` and `FORCE_API_BASE` (default `https://force.app`) from env
- **Phase 1 — local stdio:** `npx -y @force/mcp`. Claude Desktop config:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "force": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@force/mcp"], "env": { "FORCE_API_KEY": "fc_live_..." } }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Phase 2 — hosted:** same server, HTTP/SSE transport, deployed (Vercel or Fly). Users add `{ "url": "https://mcp.force.app", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer fc_live_..." } }`. No infra needed until phase 1 has users.

### E. Phasing

1. Migration + middleware + `/api/v1/contract` end-to-end (one route proves the pattern)
2. Remaining `/api/v1/*` routes
3. Settings UI
4. MCP package (local stdio)
5. Publish to npm + docs
6. *(later)* Hosted MCP

### Open questions

- Single scope set vs. per-resource (current plan does per-resource — keep?)
- Do you want key expiry now or punt (default to never-expires for simplicity)?
- Package name on npm — `@force/mcp`, `force-mcp`, something else?

## Track 2 — Android (Kotlin) client with system-wide blocking

**Goal:** native Android app that (a) lets the user view/edit their Force content and (b) detects when a blocked app launches and overlays a full-screen acknowledgement of their contract + today's quote until they confirm.

### A. Project shape

New top-level `android/` directory, Gradle multi-module:

```
android/
  settings.gradle.kts
  build.gradle.kts            (root)
  app/                        (UI module, depends on :data + :blocking)
  data/                       (Supabase client, repositories, models)
  blocking/                   (AccessibilityService, overlay, foreground service)
```

Single product flavor at first. Min SDK 26 (overlay APIs), target current.

### Tech stack

- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** + Material 3
- **DI:** Hilt
- **Auth + DB:** [supabase-kt](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-kt) — `auth-kt` + `postgrest-kt`. Reuses existing email/password accounts; RLS protects data. No need to involve the new API-key system on mobile (the user is signed in as themselves).
- **Token storage:** `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (or DataStore + Tink)
- **Settings storage:** Proto DataStore — blocked apps, schedule, cooldown
- **Async:** Kotlin coroutines + Flow

### B. Screens (Compose)

1. **Auth** — login + signup (email/password, same as web)
2. **Home** — today's contract preview, quotes carousel, goals checklist (toggle done), reflection textfield. Pull-to-refresh, auto-save with debounce.
3. **Blocklist** — picker of installed apps with search; per-app toggle
4. **Block settings** — schedule (start/end time, days), cooldown duration (default e.g. 5 min), acknowledgement gesture choice
5. **Permissions onboarding** — explainer cards that deep-link into system settings for each permission (overlay, accessibility, usage stats, notifications). Each card shows green check once granted.
6. **Account** — email, sign out

### C. Native blocking architecture

Three components working together:

```
[ForceAccessibilityService]
  - subscribes to TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED
  - on event: read event.packageName
  - if pkg ∈ blocklist
       AND within active schedule
       AND not in cooldown
    → startActivity(BlockOverlayActivity, NEW_TASK | CLEAR_TOP)
  - writes ack timestamps to DataStore (starts cooldown)

[BlockOverlayActivity]
  - full-screen Compose UI: contract markdown + today's quote
  - acknowledgement gesture: scroll through full contract, then type a short phrase
    (more friction = better; configurable)
  - on ack: write cooldown timestamp for that package, finish(); user returns to original app

[ForceForegroundService]
  - persistent low-priority notification "Force is watching"
  - keeps the process alive across Doze
  - holds the in-memory cooldown map + schedule
```

Plus:

- `BootCompletedReceiver` → re-arms the foreground service after reboot
- `PackageReplacedReceiver` → re-arms after app update
- Optional `UsageStatsManager` for an "apps opened today" stat on Home

### Permissions (Manifest)

- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
- `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` (declared on the service; user grants via Settings)
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` (Android 14+; verify category against current Play policy)
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+)
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
- `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` (optional)
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` (needed for the blocklist picker; Play requires you justify it in store listing)

### D. Phasing

1. **P0** — Gradle scaffold, Compose theming, Supabase auth, Home screen reading/writing `contents` via supabase-kt
2. **P1** — Settings screens, blocklist picker, permission onboarding flow
3. **P2** — AccessibilityService + BlockOverlayActivity + ForegroundService + cooldown logic. Test on a real device — emulators are unreliable for overlays.
4. **P3** — Polish: schedules, stats, share quote, widgets, daily reflection reminder

### Open issues / risks

- **Play Store review:** apps using `AccessibilityService` for non-accessibility purposes get reviewed harder. Need a clear in-app explainer of why the service is needed, plus a video for review. Real risk of rejection; have a fallback distribution plan (sideload + maybe Samsung Galaxy Store).
- **OEM aggressiveness:** Xiaomi/Oppo/Vivo kill background services aggressively. Foreground service + battery-optimization-exemption prompt + clear instructions will be needed.
- **Acknowledgement design** is the product question, not the engineering one. Too easy = no impact. Too hard = users uninstall. Suggest making the gesture configurable from day one.
- **Reusing API keys on mobile** is technically possible but worse UX (would require web login + paste). Recommend direct Supabase auth; API keys stay for programmatic/3rd-party clients (MCP, future Zapier, etc).

## Suggested execution order across both tracks

1. Track 1 — step E.1 (migration + middleware + one `/api/v1/contract` route). Proves the API-key pattern, unblocks the rest of Track 1.
2. Track 1 — step E.2–E.3 (remaining routes + settings UI). Users can now create keys.
3. Track 1 — step E.4–E.5 (MCP package, local stdio). Shippable to early users.
4. Track 2 in parallel from this point — Android client uses Supabase auth directly, doesn't depend on Track 1.
